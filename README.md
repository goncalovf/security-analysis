<h1 align="center">Security Analysis</h1>

This project was created for my own personal use, to analyze financial securities.

If you want to see an example of its use, check the notes written when analyzing the SAWD/SDWD ETF [here](https://github.com/goncalovf/security-analysis/blob/master/vvsa/notebook/SAWD_SDWD.ipynb).

It is still a WIP. I want to add more features and also make it more accessible for general use.

If you want to contribute to these goals, feel free to do so!
